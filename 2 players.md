I found a couple of descriptions on the internet and after I got “Catan: Traders & Barbarians” as a birthday present, I scraped everything together and developed the following rules for 2 players.

These rules can be applied to the basic game, the Seafarers expansion, the Cities & Knights expansion and in some cases the Traders & Barbarians expansion.

The rules are written as if the game is played with **Seafarers** *and* **Cities & Knights**. Elements that are specific to one of these expansions are indicated as follows:

* *Italic text* refers to **Seafarers**  
* **Bold text** refers to **Cities & Knights**

All rules of the chosen game variant apply with the following adjustments:

### ***Setting up the game***

* Agree on the number of points required to win. This depends on which expansions and/or scenarios are included in the game.  
* Use one of the unused colors as a **pseudo player**.  
* Place 2 settlements for the pseudo player opposite each other on the board, in the second ring of the island (the first ring borders the sea, the second ring is one tile inland).  
* Then, players place their settlements/cities according to the standard rules.

### ***Rolling the Dice***

Each turn consists of **two rolls**. These rolls **must NOT result in the same number** (if the second roll matches the first, it must be rerolled).

* In the **first roll**, only the real players receive resources and commodities (the pseudo player does not). The active player may trade, build, sail, or play a development card (in **Cities & Knights**, multiple development cards may be played).  
* The **second roll** only produces resources and commodities. The two real players receive their own resources, but in addition, the active player also receives the resources and commodities of the pseudo player. However, during this phase, the active player **may not** trade, build, or sail. The turn then passes to the next player.

### ***Rolling a 7***

It may be agreed that the maximum number of cards a player can hold before discarding when rolling a 7 is increased from 7 to 9\. Additionally, **City Walls** from **Cities & Knights** may be used even if it is not a **Cities & Knights** game.

* A **7 on the first roll**: The player follows the standard rules for moving the robber/pirate.  
* A **7 on the second roll**: The player follows the standard rules for moving the robber/pirate, with the exception that the stolen resource or commodity is returned to the bank.

### ***Building***

If a player constructs something on their turn, the same must be built for the pseudo player. If that is not possible, the following hierarchy applies:

* If the pseudo player cannot place a **city**, they must place a **settlement**.  
* If the pseudo player cannot place a **settlement**, they must place a **road**.  
* If the pseudo player cannot place a **road**, they must place a **ship**. If this is also not possible, nothing is placed.  
* If the pseudo player cannot place a **ship**, they must place a **road**. If this is also not possible, nothing is placed.  
* **City Walls** do not need to be placed for the pseudo player.  
* If a player **buys or upgrades a knight**, they may choose whether to add a new knight or upgrade an existing one for the pseudo player. If neither is possible, a **road** must be placed instead. A knight may only be upgraded to **Mighty** if at least one of the two real players is also allowed to do so.  
  ⚠️ **Note**: If knights are upgraded or activated using a development card, the pseudo player does **not** perform any corresponding action.

### ***Longest Trade Route***

If the pseudo player has the **Longest Trade Route** (more than 5 roads/ships), they receive the "Longest Trade Route" card.

### ***Barbarian Attack (Cities & Knights)***

If the pseudo player is the **only** one with the most knights, and the players successfully defend against the barbarians, the pseudo player receives a "Defender of Catan" card.

### ***Winning the Game***

With these rules, it is (theoretically) possible for the **pseudo player to win the game**\!
